### Introduction

Welcome to the official blog of the GOSIM Foundation.

### How it Started

The GOSIM in GOSIM Foundation stands for 'Global Open-Source Innovation Meetup'

‚ÄçGOSIM emerged from the shared vision of a global open-source community. Organized by and for the community, this entirely volunteer-based endeavor has one prime objective: to provide a stage where innovative open-source projects can shine, collaborate, and evolve. It's not just a platform; it's a movement. One that wholeheartedly embraces an open, diverse, and inclusive culture. If a project is global, innovative, grass roots ,and open-source, it has found its home at GOSIM.

* Organized by and created for the open-source community.
* Subscribes to an open, diverse, and inclusive culture.
* Volunteer based.
